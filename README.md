# Bike sharing case study using linear regression
Bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike. A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered 
considerable dips in their revenues and aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people.

## General Information

The objective of the case study is to:
- understand the factors on which demand for shared bikes depend
- which variables are significant in predicting the demand and how well they describe the demand
- perform EDA on the available data and build a optimal model to predict future demand
- validate the model against test data
- the dataset can be found here : https://ml-course2-upgrad.s3.amazonaws.com/Linear+Regression+Assignment/Bike+Sharing+Assignment/day.csv

## Conclusions
- Demand for bikes has increased YoY. Although the dataset provides 2 year data, this trend is expected.
- Demand is dependent on the outdoor conditions like Temperature, Mist, Snow and is highest during clear weather
- Seasonality is seen with few months (again related to weather) witness higher demand
- holidays and weekends do not contribute much to variation in demand
